# School-Project-Game 

This is a non-graphical, text-based game created by me for my 11th school project in python.  
  
It features several mini-games in itself like 21 matchsticks, hangman, hot or cold, etc and follows the player's quest. It also has many chocies throughout the game and the game's ending depends on the choices made by the player.  
I have uploaded the newer version of the game with added features. This was the prototype version for my year long project. The idea for this game was inspired from the novels 'Lord of the Rings' & 'The Hobbit'...
